CD: Checking Disabled
<p>
    The CD bit exists in order to allow a security-aware resolver to
    disable signature validation in a security-aware name server's
    processing of a particular query.
</p>
<p>
    The name server side MUST copy the setting of the CD bit from a query
    to the corresponding response.
