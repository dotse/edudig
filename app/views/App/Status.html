    This 4 bit field is set as part of responses.  The values have the following interpretation:
</p>
<p>0   No error condition</p>
<p>1   Format error - The name server was unable to interpret the query.</p>
<p>2   Server failure - The name server was unable to process this query due to a problem with the name server.</p>
<p>3   Name Error - Meaningful only for responses from an authoritative name server, this code signifies that the domain name referenced in the query does not exist.</p>
<p>4   Not Implemented - The name server does not support the requested kind of query.</p>
<p>5   Refused - The name server refuses to perform the specified operation for
policy reasons.  For example, a name server may not wish to provide the
information to the particular requester, or a name server may not wish to perform
a particular operation (e.g., zone transfer) for particular data.</p>
