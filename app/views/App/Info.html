<strong>dig</strong> is a flexible tool for interrogating DNS name servers. It performs DNS lookups and displays the answers
that  are  returned  from  the  name  server(s) that were queried. Most DNS administrators use dig to trou-
bleshoot DNS problems because of its flexibility, ease of use, and clarity of output.  Other  lookup  tools
tend to have less functionality than <strong>dig</strong>.
